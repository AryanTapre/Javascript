# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a professional weather application that provides current weather information for any location. The application will be built as a robust, maintainable JavaScript class with proper error handling, configuration management, and extensible architecture to support future enhancements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a weather API client class that can be easily configured and instantiated, so that I can integrate weather functionality into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WeatherApp class is instantiated THEN the system SHALL accept optional configuration parameters
2. WHEN configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL validate all required parameters
3. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive error messages
4. WHEN the class is instantiated THEN the system SHALL provide default configuration options where appropriate

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fetch current weather data for any location, so that I can display weather information to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a location is provided THEN the system SHALL fetch current weather data from the weather API
2. WHEN the API request is successful THEN the system SHALL return structured weather data
3. IF the location is not found THEN the system SHALL return a meaningful error message
4. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without blocking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that my application can gracefully handle API failures and network issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error information
2. WHEN network connectivity fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle the response appropriately
4. WHEN invalid API keys are used THEN the system SHALL provide clear authentication error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the weather data to be properly typed and structured, so that I can easily work with the response data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weather data is returned THEN the system SHALL provide a consistent data structure
2. WHEN temperature data is included THEN the system SHALL support multiple unit systems
3. WHEN location data is returned THEN the system SHALL include normalized location information
4. WHEN additional weather details are available THEN the system SHALL include relevant meteorological data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration flexibility, so that I can adapt the weather client to different APIs or requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN different weather APIs are needed THEN the system SHALL support configurable endpoints
2. WHEN API versions change THEN the system SHALL allow version configuration
3. WHEN custom request parameters are needed THEN the system SHALL support parameter extension
4. WHEN different response formats are required THEN the system SHALL provide transformation options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper logging and debugging capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL optionally log request details
4. WHEN responses are received THEN the system SHALL optionally log response summaries
