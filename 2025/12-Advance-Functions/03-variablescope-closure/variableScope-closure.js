/**
 * In JavaScript, every running function, code block {...}, and the script as a whole have an internal (hidden) associated object known as the Lexical Environment.

The Lexical Environment object consists of two parts:

Environment Record â€“ an object that stores all local variables as its properties (and some other information like the value of this).
A reference to the outer lexical environment, the one associated with the outer code.
